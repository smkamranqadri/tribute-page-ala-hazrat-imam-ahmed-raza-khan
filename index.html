      <h2 class="padding10px backColorSilver">Beliefs</h2>
      Ahmed Raza Khan was A Muslim scholar, belonging to Sufi traditions. He supported Tawassul, Mawlid, Knowledge of Unseen for Prophet and other Sufi practices which were opposed by Wahabi and Deobandis.[31] [37] [38]

In this context he supported the following beliefs:

Muhammad, although insan-e-kamil (perfect human), possessed a nūr or "light" that predates creation. This contrasts with the Deobandi view that Muhammad, was only a insan-e-kamil ("complete man"), a respected but physically typical human just like other humans.[39][40]
Muhammad is haazir naazir (can be present in many places at the same time by the power given by Allah, :[41]
We do not hold that anyone can equal the knowledge of Allah Most High, or possess it independently, nor do we assert that Allah's giving of knowledge to the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) is anything but a part. But what a patent and tremendous difference between one part [the Prophet's] and another [anyone else's]: like the difference between the sky and the earth, or rather even greater and more immense.

— Ahmed Raza Khan, al-Dawla al-Makkiyya (c00), 291.
He passed following judgements with regard to certain practices and faith in his book Fatawa-e-Razvia.[42][43] [44]

Islamic Law Shari'ah is the ultimate law and following it is obligatory for all Muslims;
To refrain from Bid'ah is of utmost importance;
A Sufi without knowledge or a Shaykh without actions is a tool in the hands of the devil;
It is impermissible to imitate the Kuffar, to mingle with the misguided [and heretics] and to participate in their festivals.
